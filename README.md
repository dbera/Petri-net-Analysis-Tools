# PnAT: Tools for Analysis and Visualization of Petri nets

PnAT is a set of tools to analyze and visualize Petri nets and and its reachability graph. It works well with [Yasper](http://www.yasper.org/), a modeling and simulation tool for Petri nets. The idea is that a user defines a Petri net model in Yasper and then uses PnAT in conjunction to analyze structural and behavioral properties. 

Some properties such as open petri nets, leg and choice properties are specific to models describing communicating component-based system. In such a system, components provide and consume services over interfaces. An interface is defined as a portnet [1]. A component net is defined in terms of refinements with provided and required portnets [1]. Such models can be modeled in Yasper using the subnets feature and interpreting reference places as interface places of a component.

Beware that subnets more than one level deep are uninterpreted. Also ensure that all places, transitions and nets have labels. 

When you download PnAT, you will find two executable JAR files

  * **LaunchPetriNetAnalysis.jar**
    * Input: Accepts a Petri net model in PNML format (tested against models from [Yasper](http://www.yasper.org/) and [Tapaal](https://www.tapaal.net/)).
    * Analysis Options
      * state machine net
      * workflow net
      * open petri net
      * choice and leg properties
    * Generator Options
      * reachability graph (with bounds on number of steps)
      * coverability graph

  * **LaunchReachabilityGraphAnalysis.jar**
    * Input: Accepts a reachability graph file in DGS format (generated by the LaunchPetriNetAnalysis.jar application)
    * Analysis Options
